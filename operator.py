#operator -> specific symbols that helps us to perform operations on variable and values
# Example -> +,*,/,%, //,<,>,<=,>=,|=
# Types of operators: Arithemtic operation, Ralational operators and Assignment operators

### Arithmetic operator
'''
x = 6
y = 8
z = 7

sum = x + y + z
dif = y - z
product = x * y * z
div = z / x

pow = z ** y
quotient = x // y
mod = x % y

print("sum is:", sum)
print("difference is:", dif)
print("Product is:", product)
print("Division is:", div)

print("Power is:", pow)
print("Quotient is:", quotient)
print("mod is:", mod)'''

### Conditional operator
a = 4
b = 6
c = 5

print(a < b)
print(c > b)
print(b == c)
print(c != b)
print(a <= c)
print(b >= c)

name = "Gayatri"
age = 21
email = "gayatri@gmail.com"
 
print("My name is",".", name, "My age is", age, "My email id is", email)
print(f"My name is {name}. My age is {age}. My email id is {email}")   ##f -> Formatted string
